                    <p>Hello! My name is Jinhwa Roh.</p>
                    <p>I have a bachelor’s degree with double major in Clothing & Textiles and Human Environment &
                        Design. I am skilled at fashion design and garment making as well as Adobe Illustrator and
                        Photoshop. I took many classes which required team projects and those experiences enabled me to
                        become a self-motivated team player!</p>
                    <p>After graduation, I worked as a merchandiser in a fashion company for 5 years. As a merchandiser,
                        I always analyzed numbers and reported them by Excel. To be honest, I enjoyed Excel more than
                        fashion itself. I feel kind of thrill when I make a working formula and find a better, easier,
                        or faster way to finish a certain task in Excel. It may sound crazy though;)</p>
                    <p>However, I am not that weirdo. I love swimming, traveling, having some delicious foods, going out
                        with friends. I also enjoy drawing and singing. One of my best hobbies is sketching my family’s
                        everyday life! I like playing guitar although I am a beginner yet. </p>
                    <p>My new year’s resolution is “Let’s give a try!” This bootcamp is my first step in 2019. I am
                        extremely excited to meet new friends, learn new skills, and become professional!</p>
